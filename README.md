# What are the Odds? - My CS 109 Challenge Project

A statistical exploration of my parents' love story, built with React. This project analyzes the HCMST (How Couples Meet and Stay Together) dataset to uncover patterns in how couples meet and form lasting relationships, with a special focus on their story.

## Features

- Interactive data visualizations using Recharts
- Statistical analysis including:
  - Bayesian inference
  - Central Limit Theorem demonstration
  - Logistic regression modeling
- Smooth animations with Framer Motion
- Clean, modern UI with Material-UI
- Responsive design for all devices

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React
- **UI Framework**: Material-UI
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
